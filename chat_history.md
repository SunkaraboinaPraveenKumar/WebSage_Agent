Bot: ### LangGraph Deployment Options
The LangGraph Platform offers four deployment options:
1. **Self-Hosted Lite**: A free (up to 1 million nodes executed per year), limited version of LangGraph Platform that you can run locally or in a self-hosted manner.
2. **Cloud SaaS**: Hosted as part of LangSmith.
3. **Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)**: We manage the infrastructure, so you don't have to, but the infrastructure all runs within your cloud.
4. **Self-Hosted Enterprise**: Completely managed by you.

These deployment options are available across three different plans: 
* **Developer**
* **Plus**
* **Enterprise** 

Each plan has its own set of features and deployment options. The choice of deployment option depends on your specific needs and requirements.
